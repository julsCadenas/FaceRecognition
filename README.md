# Face Recognition Project

This project uses OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library to perform real-time face recognition. It captures video from your webcam, processes the frames, and identifies faces based on pre-encoded face images.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python 
pip install dlib
pip install numpy 
pip install face_recognition
```

## Notes

- The script assumes that the images are in the images directory relative to where the script is executed. 
- The image's filename should be named according to the person in the picture.
- Press 'q' to exit the video capture window.
